The timeline that you see during interactive segments is slightly different from a video timeline: you can’t smoothly seek on this timeline, but you can skip from milestone to milestone (the circles on the timeline).  The small red circles are important concept markers and the gray circles simply lead you to the previous question.  Generally the milestones are fairly close together.  We’re working on making this timeline better!
